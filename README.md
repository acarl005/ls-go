![ls-go](./img/ls-go.png)

A more colorful, user-friendly implementation of `ls` written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

You want to be able to glean a lot of information as quickly as possible from `ls`.
Colors can help your mind parse the information.
You can configure `ls` to color the output a little bit.
Configuring `ls` is a hassle though, and the colors are limited.

Instead, you can use `ls-go`.
It is highly colored by default.
It has much fewer flags so you can get the behavior you want more easily.
The colors are beautiful and semantic.
A terminal with xterm-256 colors is **required*.*

## Features

- [x] *Should* work on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
- [x] Outputs beautiful, semantic colors by default.
- [x] Show paths to symlinks, and explicitly show broken links.
- [x] Recurse down subdirectories.
- [x] Emojis (if you're into that).
- [x] Supports [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).


## Install

With `go get`:

```sh
# do this once in a while
$ go get -u github.com/acarl005/ls-go
```

With Homebrew:

```sh
brew install acarl005/homebrew-formulas/ls-go
```

## Usage

### Nerd Font Support

`ls-go` works with [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
Simply add `--nerd-font` or `-n` to get file-specific icons.
This won't work unless you have a Nerd Font installed and selected in your terminal emulator.

### Prior Art

This is inspired by [athityakumar/colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls) and [monsterkodi/color-ls](https://github.com/monsterkodi/color-ls), ported to Go, with various modifications.

## Contributing

Contributions are muchly appreciated!
Want to add a glyph for another file type?
Did I forget an edge case?
Is there another option that would be useful?

You might want to submit an issue first to make sure it's something I'd want to add though.
